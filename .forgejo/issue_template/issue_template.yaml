        Please search the man page (`foot.ini(5)` and `foot(1)`);
        maybe the feature already exists?

        If the feature does not exist in your installed version of
        foot, please check the **latest** version of foot; maybe the
        feature has already been added?

        Please describe your feature request in as much details as
        possible. Describe your use case. Explain why the existing
        feature set is not sufficient. Foot is (trying to be) a
        minimalistic terminal emulator; explain how your desired
        feature does not add bloat.
