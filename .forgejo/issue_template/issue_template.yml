        Other software
        --------------

        **Compositors**: have you tested other compositors? Does the
        issue happen on all of them, or only your main compositor?

        **Terminal multiplexers**: are you using tmux, zellij, or any
        other terminal multiplexer?  Does the bug happen in a plain
        foot instance?

        **IME** do you use an IME? Which one? Does the bug happen if
        you disable the IME?

        Obtaining logs and stacktraces
        ------------------------------

        Use a [debug
        build](https://codeberg.org/dnkl/foot/src/branch/master/INSTALL.md#debug-build)
        of foot if possible, to get a better quality stacktrace in
        case of a crash.

        Run foot with logging enabled:
        ```sh
        foot -d info 2> foot.log
        ```

        In many cases, tracing the Wayland communication is extremely helpful:
        ```sh
        WAYLAND_DEBUG=1 foot -d info 2> foot.wayland.log
        ```

        Reproduce your problem as quickly as possible, and then exit foot.
